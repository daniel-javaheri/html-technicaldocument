HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
  </p>
<p>
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

What is HTML?
  </h1>
  </header>
<p>
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:
  </p>
<code>
My cat is very grumpy
  </code>
<p>
If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph element:
  </p>
<code>
"p" My cat is very grumpy "p"
  </code>
<br>
<br>
<li>
Cats really are very grumpy
  </li>

Nesting Elements

<p>
Nesting elements

Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a strong element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
  </p>
<code>
"p" My cat is "strong" very "/strong" grumpy. "/p"
  </code>
<p>
There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p.

The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:
  </p>
<code>
"p" My cat is "strong" very grumpy. /p> /strong
  </code>
<br>
<br>
<li>
The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.

Block versus inline elements
  </h1>
  </header>
<p>
Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
  </p>
<p>
Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an "a" element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as "em" or "strong" create emphasis.
  </p>
<code>
"em"first"/em"em"second"/em"em"third"/em"

"p"fourth"/p" "p"fifth"/p" "p"sixth"/p"
  </code>
<br>
<br>
<li>
"em" "strong" "a" "p"
  </li>

Empty elements
  </h1>
  </header>
<p>
Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the "img" element embeds an image file onto a page:
  </p>
<code>
"img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png""
  </code>
<p>
This would output the Firefox logo

Empty elements are sometimes called void elements.
